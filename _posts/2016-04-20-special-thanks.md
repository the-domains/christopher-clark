There are a number of people without whom _The Humming Blade _would not be a thing. These people range from my closest friends and family to complete strangers. Luckily, through the magic of Kickstarter, a novel was born. I promised these people that their names would live forever as tribute. However, there are apparently some questionable legalities with regard to publishing the names of a bunch of random people. So I've opted to host the list here, where these intrepid trailblazers will always remain immortalized.

So to the following people, thank you. You've done something so incredible for me that I will never be able to truly express my thanks.
