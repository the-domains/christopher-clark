I'm Chris. I write books, but that's really only a small part of it.

I didn't know that I wanted to be a writer until college, when my education was getting me nowhere fast. In retrospect, it should've been pretty obvious. In elementary school, when the class would get creative writing assignments, the other kids would write a couple paragraphs. I'd churn out ten, fifteen hand-written pages, stories about wizards and dragons and warriors. I've been playing tabletop games since I was about thirteen, learning how to tell stories in an organic, completely personal and improvised way. I've been reading fantasy novels since I was old enough to read. I credit Brian Jacques with really getting me into the genre - Redwall was the first actual novel I ever read, a purchase I made at a book fair in second grade with some hard-earned allowance money. I still have that book, and many others written by him.

None of these things qualify me to write, of course. No, the publishers want to know who I know, how I can put out my product, how I can generate the most content and move it in the most efficient way. In short, they don't actually care about how good the book is or how much heart it's written with - they just care if I can sell it for them. It's no wonder that this model isn't working so well anymore.

This blog, or maybe whatever this blog becomes, is the first step. I will have a platform, I will have a way to move my product, but I'm doing it on my terms. Maybe that'll blow up in my face. It's possible, but I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, too. I'm more worried about not trying than I am not succeeding.

I'm Chris. I write books, but that's really only a small part of it. I move the small things within your heart that resonate throughout the rest of you. I tell stories. I speak small words that, united together, become great things.
