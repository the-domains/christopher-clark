We're now a few weeks into the launch of the book. I've got nearly all of my KS rewards boxed up and ready to go out (if they haven't already gone out) and I'm excited to move into the next phase.

Selling this book, as it turns out, is challenging. I'm not really expecting it to shatter any records, but I'd like to make back a few dollars for my pocketbook. So that being said, how do I do that? Well, when I figure out the game plan I'll be the first to let you guys know. But honestly the best thing to do right now seems to be start sending it places and getting the word out. I'm hoping to have something circulating the local media soon.

I've also got to start looking into a stand at local conventions and such. Maybe even drag a stack of books downtown to a First Friday event and hawk them from a street-corner if I have to. Whatever it takes, right?

Just in case you didn't notice - yes, the ridiculous gifs will continue to be a part of my blog. Why? Well, when I figure that one out I'll let you know.
