It is a novel about many things, but primarily it is the story of Wyatt Arden, a farm-grown young man in his late teens with a great deal of unused talent. At the outset of the novel, he is filled with conflicting desires to both remain at home and to venture out into the world seeking adventure. His best friend, Desmond, has already joined the Imperial Army, something that the two of them had originally planned to do together. Desmond was unable to justify continuing his life at home, however, and couldn't wait any longer for Wyatt to join him. So Wyatt must say goodbye to his friend and confront his conflicting feelings about his lot in life. </p><p>However, before Wyatt has much time to dwell, new events transpire that lead him down a very different path. He dreams of a magical sword, only to find that sword hidden deep underground, along with a mysterious creature which lives within the blade. Without much of a chance to ask questions, his house explodes and his family vanishes. A group of strange travelers find him unconscious and wounded, using magical powers to heal his wounds. They join forces in what is initially a tentative, cautious alliance, both sides having very different goals; Wyatt desires only to find his mother, while the others are seeking to put an end to the machinations of a powerful Necromancer named Apep the Snake, who has dark plans for an ancient ritual.</p><p>Wyatt and his new allies embark on a harrowing journey across the world, hoping to disrupt Apep's plans and save Wyatt's family. They fight not only for their personal goals, but for the safety of the entire world, a world threatened by the power of Apep's dark designs. As they fight for life and liberty, unseen hands move other pieces around the board, hands that have goals much greater than Apep's. Wyatt and the others fight with everything they have to stop those dark powers that lurk beyond sight, powers that have lain in wait for centuries for Wyatt to be born.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="39"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="41"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="42"><span data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --><h2 data-reactid="45"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="46">About the Book</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="49"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
