            <title><![CDATA[About the First Book]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Aah, the book. Everyone wants to know about the book. Well, I'll tell you what I can, straight from the source. The first thing that you should know is that, well, it's not out yet. But soon! I'm planning on releasing it independently to Amazon and other ebook publishers. Once I have a decent following, we'll look at a print publication somewhere down the line. I'll also be using this blog to post excerpts! </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Special Thanks]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of people without whom The Humming Blade would not be a thing. These people range from my closest friends and family to complete strangers. Luckily, through the magic of Kickstarter, a novel was born. I promised these people that their names would live forever as tribute. However, there are apparently some questionable legalities with regard to publishing the names of a bunch of random people. So I've opted to host the list here, where these intrepid trailblazers will always remain immortalized.</p>]]></description>
